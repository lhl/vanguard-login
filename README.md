# vanguard-login
Logging into Vanguard account for automation

Adapted from https://github.com/lhl/schwab-login
There is a vanguard-api project that is wrapped around a docker setup, but you can probably just access the vanguard library directly: https://github.com/rikonor/vanguard-api/tree/master/seleniumapis/vanguard

UPDATE: Actually that library looks pretty well thought out and has had some relatively recent updates, so this was just for fun I guess.
UPDATE 2: Oh, vanguard-api is Python 2 and has some exception even w/ updating the basic lib to parse in Python 3 so maybe worth continuing work on this later...
